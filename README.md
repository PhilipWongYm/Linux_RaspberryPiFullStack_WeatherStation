# Raspberry Pi Full Stack with Raspbian
I created this repository while working through the course Raspberry Pi:Full Stack with Raspbian, from Tech Explorations.  

The objective for me to take the course was to have a better understanding and have hands-on exposure working on Linux environment (Raspbian OS namely) and Phyton.  This is not the origianl repository I've made while doing the course, the original repository I've deleted by Mid- to End- of 2019, as at the time I didn't felt the need to keep the repository for a completed project that was archieved for about a year already.

However, situation have changed, and I was required to reupload past project to showcase works that I've done previously and hence the reupload.
